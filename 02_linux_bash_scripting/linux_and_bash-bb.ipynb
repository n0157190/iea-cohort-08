All the while, adding their favorite programs and approaches to their personalized toolbox. However, there always remains parts of the system to discover.  Moreover, there almost always different ways to solve the same problem with none of them being necessarily better or worse. \n",

    "The result is that even users who have years of experience using Linux or Unix (like myself) can be pleasantly (or last least amusingly) surprised by learning about a previously unknown (to them) option to a command or even a command itself.  It keeps it fresh, always leaving from to learn more, improve your technique, and hone your craft, much like any more traditional artisan. \n",
